Description:
        Handles object streaming for >150 objects per player.  Also provides VW
        support and improved object attachment (i.e. it works).  New versions
        combines mine and Peter's streaming systems to narrow down objects by
        approximation by a grid system then check all objects visible in near
        by sections.

                Made some core functions static so they don't get called by accident.
                Changed auto-adjust code so it rounds to nearest whole log number.
                Moved zone-find code around to skip whole columns at once.
                Added zone sorting so they're done in order of distance.

Function:

Params:

        Float:x - X location to check.
        Float:y - Y location to check.
        sectors[OBJECT_VIEW_SECTORS][E_OSEC_ITTER] - Array to store all visible sectors.
        &secStart - Start point to itterator
Return:
        -
Notes:
        Finds all the sectors which encompas points within the sight range of the
        player.  Initial checks are done as a square so some returned sectors may
        not have points within a circular range of the player.

        The original version tested if the edges of each sector were visible and
        if not excluded them from the list.  This would have been faster in terms
        of objects checked but slower if there were no objects, which is likely to
        be more frequently the case.  The code also didn't actually work but that's
        a minor point as the theory was there.  This is also alot neater.

        Rewritten to not use Object_FindSector on a new area, just calculate the
        area from known initial area.

        Now also only returns the zones visible, not the zones theoretically
        visible (still assumes square vision though which the code doesn't use).

Function:

Params:
        modelid - Model to check won't crash SA.
Return:
        -
Notes:
        I wrote this function a long time ago and have barely updated it at all.
        The only changes are the formatting and the use of the Bit class now,
        despite the fact this was the first large bit array I did and is thus
        the founding array of the whole idea behind the bit class.
